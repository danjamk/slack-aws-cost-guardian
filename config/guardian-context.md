# My AWS Environment

This is my personal AWS account. I use it for my own learning and R&D.

## Cost Expectations

- I generally like my ongoing costs to be close to zero
- Historical monthly budget: less than $1.00
- There are times where I might let some costs run for a while, but I almost always want to return back to low cost
- Since it is personal, I need to be very careful about letting any service with material cost run for very long
